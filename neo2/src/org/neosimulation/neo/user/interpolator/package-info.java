/**
 * This package contains a set of utilities that have been determined to be
 * essential to the NEO Framework and model development. The utilities are
 * called interpolators because they provide interpolation over a set of data.
 * Where the data is assumed to be in a 2 column format with the first column
 * containing the variable to be queried from and the second column containing
 * the data to be the interpolated value.
