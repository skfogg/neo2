/**
 * This package contains the classes which make the most complicated subsystem
 * of the NEO framework, the Populator, function. Included here is the different
 * possible strategies the populator can use to load statevals and dynams, the
 * different strategies used to populate holons, the means to compare items in
 * an inheritance hierarchy, and a modified classloader which allows dynams to
 * be loaded on the fly at runtime.
